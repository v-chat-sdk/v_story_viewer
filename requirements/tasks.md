## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each task should be completed with working, testable code
- No task should leave orphaned or unused code
- All public APIs must follow V-prefix naming convention
- Maintain strict separation: one class per file
- Use sealed classes for type safety where applicable
- Use Flutter best practices for build widgets and code
- Each Flutter class or widget should be in separate dart file!
- Follow single responsibility principle - each class does ONE thing
- Use composition over inheritance where possible
- Implement dispose() methods for all controllers and streams
- Use const constructors wherever possible for performance

### Widget Building Guidelines
- Always use `const` for widgets that don't change
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` when state isn't needed
- Extract complex widget trees into separate widget classes
- Use `Key` types appropriately for widget identity
- Implement `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` only when necessary
- Avoid deep widget nesting - extract into methods or widgets
- Use `Builder` widgets to get correct context when needed
- Never call `setState()` during build
- Cache expensive computations with `late final` or memoization

### State Management Rules
- Controllers should extend `ChangeNotifier`, not use multiple `ValueNotifier`s
- Call `notifyListeners()` only after state actually changes
- Always dispose controllers in widget `dispose()` method
- Use `WidgetsBindingObserver` for app lifecycle
- Avoid rebuilding entire widget tree - use targeted rebuilds
- Implement proper error states in controllers
- Never expose mutable state directly - use getters
### File Organization Standards

### Performance Requirements
- Maintain 60 FPS during all animations and transitions
- Keep memory usage under 50MB for typical story sequences
- Complete story transitions within 100ms
- Implement efficient caching and cleanup strategies
- Dispose video controllers when not in view
- Use `RepaintBoundary` for expensive widgets
- Implement lazy loading for story lists
- Preload only next 2 stories maximum
- Release resources immediately when story dismissed

### Memory Management Checklist
- [ ] Dispose all `AnimationController`s
- [ ] Dispose all `VideoPlayerController`s
- [ ] Close all `StreamController`s
- [ ] Cancel all `Timer`s and `StreamSubscription`s
- [ ] Clear cache for dismissed stories
- [ ] Remove listeners when widgets unmount
- [ ] Nullify large objects when done
- [ ] Use weak references where appropriate

### Error Handling Pattern
```dart
try {
  // Operation
} on SpecificException catch (e) {
  // Handle specific error
  _handleError(VSpecificError(e.message));
} catch (e) {
  // Handle generic error
  _handleError(VGenericError('Operation failed', e));
}

### Testing Strategy

- Don't write any kind of tests now - we don't need it
- Focus on implementation correctness
- Manual testing through example app is sufficient
- Code Quality Standards
- Follow Flutter best practices and conventions
- Use proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Implement comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- Ensure thread safety for all concurrent operations
- Each Flutter class or widget should be in separate dart file!
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add dartdoc comments for all public APIs
- Keep methods under 30 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into private methods

### Async Operation Guidelines

- Always use async/await instead of .then()
- Handle all possible exceptions in async methods
- Use FutureBuilder for async UI updates
- Implement loading states for all async operations
- Add timeouts for network operations
- Cancel ongoing operations when widget disposes
